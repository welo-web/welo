The directory app/Http/Middleware is intended to contain middleware classes that filter HTTP requests entering the application. Since you have not specified any particular middleware to create, I will provide a basic structure for a middleware class.

Here is the content for the file app/Http/Middleware/ExampleMiddleware.php:

<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class ExampleMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Perform some action before the request is handled

        return $next($request);
    }
}
